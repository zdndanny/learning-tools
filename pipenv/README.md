# learning pipenv

Pipenv: Python Development Workflow for Humans [https://docs.pipenv.org/]
The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:

- You no longer need to use pip and virtualenv separately. They work together.
- Managing a requirements.txt file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.
- Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.
- Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks arising from outdated components.
- Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. $ pipenv graph).
- Streamline development workflow by loading .env files.
